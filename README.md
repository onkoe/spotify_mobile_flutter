# spotify_mobile_flutter

A recreation of Spotify in Flutter, made for these improvements:

- Social music discovery
- Intuitive navigation
- Engaging playback
- Better downloads

IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS IS FOR AN HCI CLASS, MEANING IT DOES NOT CONNECT TO THE SPOTIFY API! IT IS MORE OF A CONCEPT. (if you've found this expecting an actual Spotify client, we're very sorry!)

## Setup

You'll need Flutter v3.29.2 or newer. Install it according to [these instructions](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first#1). I'm using Zed Editor, but VSCode should work great, too!
- Install Flutter and common build tools, like MSVC/VS on Windows, the `"Development Tools"` metapackage on Fedora, or `build-essential` on Ubuntu.
- Make sure everything is happy in `flutter doctor`
- Install [`just`](https://just.systems/man/en/pre-built-binaries.html).
- `git clone <repo>`
- `just run`

## Binaries

There are (hopefully) some binaries on GitHub. Link those, and also put it on the Web for our course staff to see.
